# everywhere.js-interface
Boilerplate for JavaScript-powered Web Interfaces

### Synopsis
everywhere.js is a collection of JavaScript boilerplate repositories which
exist to provide an immediate entry point to development whenever inspiration
stikes. The goal of the project is to provide a boilerplate repository for
every (reasonable) platform that JavaScript runs on. The concept behind each
repository is to have a near-zero startup time, but also act as a blank
canvas.

This repository provides an Angular2-powered single page app.
